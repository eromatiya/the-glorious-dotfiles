If you're having an issue... Well, that's why you're here right? 

### IMPORTANT NOTE: Ricing and this dotfiles are not my priority right now. So if you have a question, read the wiki first! Make sure to check the dependencies and requirements to avoid avoidable errors! If it's a bug, uhm well, like I said in the first sentence, this is not my priority anymore. Pull request is appreciated.

If you're having a problem or question on why certain things doesn't work, did you already read the wiki? Do you have the needed dependencies installed? If no, please read it.
