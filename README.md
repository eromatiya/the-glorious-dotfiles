### Welcome to the glorious dotfiles

<img src="images/setups.png" align="right" height="400px">

<p align="left">
This is a collection/stash of my linux configurations also known as <b><i>dotfiles</i></b>. I don't know why did I wasted my time writing these, especially my AwesomeWM setups. Or maybe it's because... I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really -- I was alive. ;) So no wasted time after all.

About my setup, I'm using **Archlinux** btw, and I think everyone should know about that. **[AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/)** is my window manager. I think it is best window manager in my honest opinion if you spend some effort and time into it.  The strength of it is its flexibility, you can create your own widget, panels, pop-ups, design your own UI/UX in whatever you like. That's the beauty of Awesome WM.

Anyway, I provided a documentation or **[wiki](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles/wiki)** focusing on my AwesomeWM setups. It also contains some useful information about ricing so I can help the aspiring linux ricers. Make sure to read it if you're planning to use my setups!

So, what is ricing or RICE in the linux world? Ricing refers to making a visual improvement and customization on your desktop. It was inherited from the practice of improving, modifying, and customizing a cheap asian import cars to make them appear faster than they actually are. So in the world of cars, <b>RICE</b> means <i>Race Inspired Cosmetic Enhancement</i>.
<br>
<br>
Ricing is actually fun and it's my hobby for quite a long time now. Anyone can rice. Also, your distro doesn't matter. You can rice on ubuntu, manjaro, debian, and the list goes on. I'm just using archlinux because it's so easy to use and I love it. The pacman and aur is the selling point for me, and these guys prevent me to distrohop again. There's also no <i>"best"</i> in ricing. There's no best window manager, best distro, best icon theme, so stop asking that. That "best" one is the one that will compliment you and your workflow well. Experiment. Have a vision on what you are trying to do. Then, do it. Just do it. :wink: Enough with the blabbering and happy hacking! :)

### required dependencies

| Name | Description | Why/Where is it needed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`awesome-git`](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome) |  Highly configurable framework window manager | isn't it obvious? |
| [`rofi-git`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) | Window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement | Application launcher |
| [`tryone144's picom`](https://github.com/tryone144/compton/tree/feature/dual_kawase) | A compositor for X11 | a compositor with kawase-blur |

### installation and usage

1. Install the [required dependencies](#required-dependencies). Note that there's also an [optional dependencies](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles/wiki/Dependencies#optional-dependencies).
2. Clone this repository.

	```bash
	$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles/
	```

3. Make sure to create a backup if you have a current AwesomeWM configuration.
4. Copy the `the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/SETUPNAME` folder to your `"${HOME}"/.config/`. I'll just assume that you don't have an `awesome` folder in your `~/.config/`:

	```bash
	# Use the Floppy setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/floppy $HOME/.config/awesome

	# Use the GNawesOME setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/gnawesome $HOME/.config/awesome

	# Use the Linear setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/linear $HOME/.config/awesome
	```

5. Reload AwesomeWM by pressing <kbd>Super + Shift + r</kbd>.
