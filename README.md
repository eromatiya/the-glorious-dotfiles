		Welcome to the glorious dotfiles!
	</b>
</p>

<p align='center'>
	<br/>
	This is a collection/stash of my linux configurations also known as dotfiles. I don't know why did I wasted my time writing these, especially my AwesomeWM setups. Or maybe it's because... I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really -- I was alive. ;) So no wasted time after all. You're probably here because of my awesome dotfiles. So yeah, steal what you want. Don't forget to check my <a href='https://github.com/manilarome/'>other projects!</a>
</p>


## [Wiki here](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles/wiki)

The wiki will guide you to replicate my setups. So read the frickin' manual! If you post an issue that can be solve by reading it, I'll drop kick you.

## Summary and details

If you're too lazy to read the wiki, here's some of the details you need to know.

### Required dependencies

### Installation and usage

1. Install the [required dependencies](#required-dependencies). Note that there's also an [optional dependencies](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles/wiki#optional-dependencies).
2. Clone this repository.

	```bash
	$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles/
	```

3. Make sure to create a backup if you have a current AwesomeWM configuration.
4. Copy the `the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/SETUPNAME` folder to your `"${HOME}"/.config/`. I'll just assume that you don't have an `awesome` folder in your `~/.config/`:

	```bash
	# Use the Floppy setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/floppy $HOME/.config/awesome

	# Use the GNawesOME setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/gnawesome $HOME/.config/awesome

	# Use the Linear setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/linear $HOME/.config/awesome

	# Use the Surreal setup
	$ cp -r the-glorious-dotfiles/config/awesome/surreal $HOME/.config/awesome
	```

4. Change the global configuration in `$HOME/.config/awesome/configuration/config.lua`.
5. Reload AwesomeWM by pressing <kbd>Super + Shift + r</kbd>.

## TODOs

My TODOs or roadmap for my awesomewm setups.

- [x] Scrollable Notification Center<sup>needs improvement</sup>
- [x] Lockscreen PAM Integration
- [x] Multi-monitor support  
- [x] Refactor for cleaner code<sup>WIP</sup>
- [x] Extend the screen recorder widget's functionality
- [x] Adjust picom's blur strength using a slider


## Selling the dotfiles

Why would I want this?

### Core features

These are the features included in my AwesomeWM setups!

+ Notification Center
+ Dynamic Wallpaper
+ File/Web Searching like macOS' Spotlight
+ Application Dashboard
+ Brightness and Volume OSDs
+ Functional Trash Widget
+ Built-in Screen Recorder Widget
+ Built-in Calculator Widget
+ Email Widget
+ Weather Widget
+ Quake Terminal
+ Hardware Monitor
+ Blue Light Filter Widgets 
+ Lockscreen Module with Face Capture and PAM Integration
+ Easter eggs!<sup>Mostly bugs</sup>
+ Any many more!

I don't really rice just to make it beautiful, I want it to be also functional so that's why it's ***"bloated"*** with features.

### Gallery

Some of these are outdated, so it is better if you try them yourself.

	<b>
		Floppy
	</b>
	<br>
	Floppy was meant to be a clone of the infamous <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/apktsx/flurry_i_know_you_like_tiling_managers_and_i_want/'>Flurry Desktop</a>. I named it Floppy because I thought it would flop when I first <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/de0m3v/awesome_floppy/'>posted it on r/unixporn</a>. This is my favorite.

	<br/>
	<b>
		GNawesOME
	</b>
	<br>
	Yes, GNawesOME is a weird name. GNawesOME was meant to be a GNOME clone. Instead, it became a hybrid of macOS, iOS, GNOME, and Deepin. I regret nothing.

		Linear
	</b>
	<br>
	A setup full of borders and lines. Awesome right?

	<br>
	Yes, I copied the macOS Big Sur design. Many linux elitists will hate it but I don't care. Cry me a river.
